"## Usage\n\nFirst, identify the icon that you want to use. You can see the full list of icons\nin [**the catalog**](/icons/catalog). Material provides nearly one thousand icons, so it can be\nuseful to narrow your results using the filter functionality on that page.\n\nOnce you find an icon, you can click it to see the import statement that you can use\nin your code.\n\nImagine that we want an icon related to wifi. After typing \"wifi\" into the\nsearch box, we can see the one that we want: `IconWifiLock`.\n\nClicking it shows us the import statement:\n\n```jsx\nimport IconWifiLock from 'materialish/icon-wifi-lock';\n```\n\nFrom here, we can use it as we would any other React component. And remember, because the icons are\nSVG, you do not need to load any CSS to use them.\n\n## Props\n\n| Prop Name | Default Value | Description                                      |\n| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| size      | \"1em\"         | The size of the icon                             |\n| ...rest   |               | Other props are placed on the root `svg` element |\n\n## Performance\n\nYou may be wondering why each icon is shipped as an individual Component, rather\nthan as a single one. The reason is performance. Providing individual\nComponents allows you to pull in _just_ the SVG code that you need.\n\nIf performance is not an issue for you, then you can opt into importing all of the\nComponents using an alternative import syntax:\n\n```js\nimport { IconWifiLock } from 'materialish/icons';\n```\n\nYou may find this syntax preferable from a developer experience perspective, but keep in mind that you\nwill likely be importing every icon that Material provides. This could have a considerable impact on your\nbundle size, as there are roughly one thousand icons.\n"
